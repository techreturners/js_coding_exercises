# Exercises 002

These challenges encourage you to keep on practicing your JavaScript skills!

1. Run `npm run eslint` in your terminal. Make sure you fix any linting errors from the previous challenges.

2. If you made any changes in the previous 2 steps, make sure to commit them.

3. Look at the `test/exercise002.test.js` file where you will see the tests for this set of challenges.

4. Complete the functions in `challenges/exercise002.js` in order to make the tests pass.

👉 Remember that you can pause tests or run only specific tests - see the main [README.md](../README.md) file for details.
