# Exercises 007 🤵

Well done for getting this far! 🎉 🥳

Once again, we'd like you to write your own unit tests.

Remember, there is a video on Unit Testing available here:

[Writing your own Unit Tests](https://storage.googleapis.com/tech-returners-course/JavaScript_Challenges/unit_testing.mp4)

Work through the exercises in a TDD (Test Driven Development) approach of Red -> Green -> Refactor

In these exercises you have covered forLoops, ES6 methods like `.map()` and `.forEach()`, eslint, Test Driven Development and more!

Lastly, see [Exercise008](./exercise008.md) for one final activity.
